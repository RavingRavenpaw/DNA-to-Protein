    #GENERAL INFO
    #------------------------------------------
    #
    #DNA Base Pairs:
    #A-T, C-G
    #Adenine and Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine
    #
    #RNA Base Pairs:
    #A-U, C-G
    #Adenine and Uracil, Cytosine and Guanine
    #I know RNA is almost always single-stranded so bonding
    #between the bases doesn't matter, but sometimes
    #it happens!
    #
    #Amino Acids & Corresponding Codons:
    #No idea. I'll look this up later.
